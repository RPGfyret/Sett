# Quotes
1. "This is another beautiful thing about solo roleplaying: you have tremendous control over how you play, not just in the narrative of the adventure itself but in the meta aspect of what rules you use and how you use them."
2. "How often you choose instead of roll is your choice as well. If you want to have more narrative control over your adventure you may choose frequently or always. If you want a game with more surprises you may choose rarely or never."
3. "My advice is to listen to your gut and trust yourself. Open your mind, and don’t treat the prompt like it defines your interpretation. Instead, see the prompt for what it is: a starting point from which you can take your interpretation anywhere that’s fun and makes sense to you."
4. "In the end, deciding what should be an active element in your adventure comes down to expectations and your own desires."
5. "One way to tell whether your Question builds on the narrative or kills it is whether you’re interested in the outcome. Does the answer to the Question interest you, or are you only asking it because you feel like you have to?"

# Fate Questions
1. Ask exciting and interesting questions.
- Chaos Factor tunes up "Yes" responses, so focus questions on the content that makes the game more fun. 
- Chaos Factor is a track of "character control", so phrase questions so your character **must** respond when they hear "yes". 
2. If it feels like cheating, it probably is. 
3. But just ask the questions in the most natural way. Not every question follows the control/action order as expected, but on average they do. The kinds of questions you ask are self-regulating depending on character control.
4. The numbers can be read like ranges: 1-Exceptional Yes-Yes-No-Exceptional No
5. "Be careful not to fall into the trap of asking for more detail than you need. [...] The goal is to gather just enough information to move things forward."
- The goal is at most 2, and at the very best 1!

# Random Events
1. "Whatever Event Focus you roll is not meant to limit you; it’s simply meant to be a starting place that helps you interpret the final result."
2. "The Positive or Negative Event can be something storyshifting and important, or it can be something minor, as long as you think it’s the most expected interpretation of your results."
3. Don't over do it, but feel free to say "I dunno" and drop a random event if its getting tiresome to include. 

# Scenes
1. "No matter what time frame you’re dealing with, the Scene is about something specific."
2. "Let yourself be guided by your interests and the main action of the Scene. Your adventure should be a string of interesting Scenes, with each one leading to the next."
